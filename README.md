Domain: Data Science
Duration: August to September 2024
Mentor: Muzammil

Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The project involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model on the training data, evaluating its performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared, and making predictions on the test set. Additionally, the project includes visualizing the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model’s accuracy.

Key Activities
Data Preprocessing:
Loading the dataset and performing initial data cleaning, such as handling missing values and converting data types.
Converting categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training a linear regression model on the training data.
Evaluating the model’s performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
Prediction and Visualization:
Making predictions on the test set.
Visualizing the regression line and actual vs. predicted values.
Visualizing the correlation matrix of the numeric columns.
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language for data analysis.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
Jupyter Notebook: The entire process is documented and executed in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows for an interactive coding environment.
